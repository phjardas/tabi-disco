# Building Instructions

This page describes the necessary hardware works to make Tabidisco work.

## Shopping List

* Raspberry Pi 3 model B
* An NFC reader module (I used [this one](https://www.conrad.de/de/raspberry-pi-erweiterungs-platine-explore-nfc2-raspberry-pi-2-b-raspberry-pi-3-b-raspberry-pi-a-raspberry-pi-b-1611054.html), but any should work)
* A stable Micro-USB power supply for the Pi
* An amplifier and speakers
* A 230V relais to switch the power supply of the aplifier
* Two buttons
* A box to contain the amplifier and the Pi
* Various cables and electronics bits and pieces

All in all (highly depending on the kind of amp and speakers you choose) these items should total to less than â‚¬ 150.
