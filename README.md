# Tabidisco: jukebox for kids powered by Raspberry Pi [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phjardas/tabidisco.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phjardas/tabidisco)

At the time of the inception of this project my daughter Tabea was not even two-and-a-half years old and loved hearing music. However, she was still too young to be able to manage the elaborate controls of an MP3 player. Hence I came up with the idea to build something accessible for her to be able to play music independently from her parents.

The contraption consists of a box with an amplifier and speakers and a Raspberry Pi with a NFC reader module. You place little stickers with RFID tags in them on various toys and connect the RFID with MP3 files stored on the Pi. Then your kids can simply place one of the tagged items onto the box and press a button, and the Pi will magically play the corresponding song.
